Here follows an explanation of all the config files, and their variables. 
Editing the configuration files by hand is not advisable. Instead, use the 
proper command to add, remove or change entries in the files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

banlist:
The banlist is a list of ip:s/hostnames that are not allowed in the hub.
An entry can be a single ip, a subnet, a hostname or a part of a hostname with
one or several wildcards ('*'). To be able to ban hostnames, reverse_dns has
to be set to 1. Here follows a few examples:

100.100.100.100        bans that address, and that address only.
100.100.100.0/24       bans 100.100.100.0 - 100.100.100.255
100.100.0.0/16	       bans 100.100.0.0 - 100.100.255.255
badcom.baddomain.com   bans that hostname, and that hostname only.
*bad*com	       bans all hostnames that contains "bad" and end with
		       "com".
*.net		       bans all hostnames that ends with ".net".
     
To add and remove entries from the banlist, use the ban and unban commands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

allowlist:
If ban_overrides_allow is set to 0, The entries on this list overrides
those on the banlist. If you want to ban a whole domain except for one or
several users, you  would put the domain name in the banlist and the allowed
users here. For example, "*.baddomain.com" in the banlist and "*goodguy*" here
would allow "goodguy.baddomain.com" but ban all other hosts on baddomain.com.
However, if ban_overrides_allow is set to 1, it will work the other way
around. Then, _only_ the entries on the allowlist will be allowed and if they
are on the banlist, they will be banned even if they are on the allowlist.
So, if you only want users on the domain "gooddomain.com" to have access to the
hub, you would set ban_overrides_allow to 1 and put "*.gooddomain.com" here.
And if you then want to ban badguy.gooddomain.com, you would put "*badguy*"
in the banlist. To allow hostnames and not only ips, reverse_dns has to be set
to 1. To add and remove entries from the allowlist, use the allow and unallow
commands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

reglist:
A list of registered users in the form <user_name> <password> <opdigit>, where
opdigit is 2 for op admin, 1 for op and 0 for regular registered users.
Scripts which are registered in the nicklist will also be registered here with
a random password. To add and remove users from this list, use the addreguser
and removereguser command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nickbanlist:
Contains entries of nicknames that are banned. The bans are case sensitive.
The '*' character can be used as a wildcard. To ban a nick that contains a 
'*' or a '\', it has to be escaped with a '\'.
For example, the banentry "bad*nick" bans all nicknames that start with "bad"
and end with "nick". Banentry "ba\\dni\*ck" bans "ba\dni*ck", and only 
"ba\dni*ck".
