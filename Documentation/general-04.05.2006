Open DC Hub

Installation:
Follow the generic installation instructions in INSTALL. To build without
Perl script support, add the argument --disable-perl to configure.

If you want to be able to switch user on startup, use the 
--enable-switch_user argument to configure. 


More information about how to write scripts for opendchub is contained in the
file scriptdoc.



The command line arguments available are:

-d          : Makes the hub print the log to the console instead of running in 
	      the background.
-h  	    : Prints a brief help and exits.
--version   : Prints the version of the program.
-l <logfile>: Sets the path to the logfile.
-s          : Uses syslog instead of a logfile.
-w  <path>  : Sets the path to the working directory. This directory will
    	      contain a tmp directory and the .opendchub directory with
	      the config files.
	      
These options are also available if you have enabled switch user mode:

-u <user>   : Run as this user.
-g <group>  : Run as this group.




Administration through chat:

It is also possible to administer the hub through the chat in Direct Connect.
To do that, a user has to be registered as an OP Admin, i.e, the op digit has
to be set to 2. The commands are the same as follows, with the difference 
that they start with a '!' instead of a '$' and they shouldn't be terminated
with a '|'.


Here is a description of the admin commands. These commands also works in the 
chat. To use them in chat, replace the '$' with at '!' and skip the '|':

!set <variable> <value>
Sets a value in the config file. The config file is located in the
.opendchub directory, which is located in the root of your home directory.
The variables are explained in configfiles, in the Documentation directory. The
program must be run once first to create the config file.
The motd is placed in a file of it's own. To change the motd, use "$Set motd".
Do not use the '|' sign inside the motd. You won't be able to put them in there
with the $Set command, and if you edit the motd file by hand, '|' signs will
confuse the clients.
When setting the min_share value, it's possible to specify the minimum share
in Bytes, MegaBytes and GigaBytes. For example, to set the minimum share to
500 MegaBytes, you would type:
$set min_share 500 MB|
And to set it to 5 GigaBytes:
$set min_share 5 GB|

!allow <ip or hostname> <time>
Adds an entry to the allowlist. This file works like the opposite of 
banlist, i.e, the entries in this file are allowed to the hub. Explained more 
detailed in configfiles.

!addreguser <nickname> <password> <op>

also gets privileges to administer the hub through the chat. If 'op is 0, 
the user is an ordinary registered user with no special privileges.
